# My Personal Coding Projects


#personal expense tracker:
started with creating the basics for collecting user input. Used tutorials and other resources to learn to use csv and os libraries. once the basics of creating the the csv, collecting input, adding input, outputing values in csv were complete, I broke the program into a single class with it's own methods to clean and make the program more modular.

next steps are to work on creating the expense tracker as a web app and make revisions/additions as necissary.
