The following projects were my first experiments with python scripting and automation during the GPU apocolypse in 2020-2021. All scripts were created using online tutorials and tweaking them to fit my use cases.

Topics covered/learned:
    -python libraries
    -automating tasks
    -parsing and interacting with web pages
    -structuring code into functions and scripts

ALL PROJECTS WERE MADE FOR LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY. THEY LIKELY DO NOT FOLLOW BEST PRACTICES, CONTAIN OUTDATED CODE, AND SHOULDN'T BE USED IN REPRODUCTION.
